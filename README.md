# Find Your Match
> Final individual assignment week #7 of Codaisseur Academy

## About
This assignment was the final individual assignment for batch #7 of the Codaisseur Academy. Its aim is to build an application that could help Codaisseurâ€™s students and teachers to make new teams of 2 students every day.
As technology for this application I chose to use Ruby on Rails.

## Current state
At this moment of writing this repository is still under construction and far from a finished state. Main focus will be to improve on Testing and refactor to create fat models & skinny controllers.


## User Stories
Admins (Teachers & Staff)
- As an Admin, I need to sign in before having access to any page in the application.
- As an Admin, I have an overview of the pairs/couples for each day.
- As an Admin, I can auto-generate pairs/couples for a specific day.
- As an Admin, I can see a list of all Users of the application and with a single click of a button promote a User to Admin, or demote a User to Student.

Students
- As a Student, I need to to sign up/register.
- As a Student, I need to sign in before having access to any page in the application.
- As a Student, after signing in, I can see my "match" for the current day. My "match" is calculated randomly among all the registered Students until that moment.
- As a Student, I am matched to another Student, but only once each day.
- As a Student I can see my matches for the past days, but not for future days.

Bonus Stories
- As an Admin, I can make Classes with a name, start date, and end date.
- As an Admin, I can assign Students to Classes.
- As an Admin, I can select a Class from the Classes list, and use that link to invite new and/or existing Students to a specific class. The Class URL is hard to guess.
- As an Admin, I can select a Class and a date, and change the team size to a higher number than 2, but no more than half of the Class size
- As a Student, do not start building these stories before all the rest is done :)

## About the Matching Algorithm
Pairs/couples are calculated randomly, but a Student is not matched with the same person twice until he/she has been matched with all the registered Students until that moment.
